## Overview

This program is SSH client program. Can simply add/delete multiple connection information in one place, and can easily manage a lot of SSH connection information from a terminal such as WSL or remote shell.

> I needed a ssh client program like [gossm](https://github.com/gjbae1212/gossm), but gossm is not support custom ssh, so I developed it. This program is a tool that makes ssh management easy and convenient to use.
